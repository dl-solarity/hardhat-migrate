# Changelog

## Version 3.0.2

- Added an ability to specify custom path for reporting
- Refactored ReporterStorage to separate contracts and transactions data structures

## Version 3.0.1

- Added BaseInstance type for better TypeChain interfaces support

## Version 3.0.0

### Breaking changes

- Removed Truffle support.
- Removed import of `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify` from the index.ts.
  - Please refer to the `Installation` section in the README for the updated installation instructions.
  - The motivation is to avoid conflicts with `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox` when using both plugins.
- Removed the default conversion of the `bigint` to `string` for the `JSON.stringify` function.
- Updated the `MigrateConfig` layout. Now similar by logic parameter are grouped together.

### New features

- Added an ability to specify namespaces for deployment scripts.

Now instead of having all deployment scripts in the `deploy` folder, tou can separate those into subfolders like below.

```
deploy
├── l1-deployment
│   ├── 1_core.migration.ts
│   └── 2_setup.migration.ts
└── l2-testnet
    ├── 1_prepare.migration.ts
    └── 2_deploy.migration.ts
```

And when running the migration, you can specify the namespace like this:
```bash
npx hardhat migrate --namespace l1-deployment
```

- Added an ability to disable address shortening in the reporter with following syntax: `PublicReporter.disableShortenAddress().reportContractsMD`

- Added file reporting throughout the migration process
  - During the migration the relevant report will be generated and stored in the `cache` folder.
  
- Added an ability to link proxy to the implementation contract
  - The linking is decided based on the presence of the `IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` in the contract

- Added helper function to the Deployer for the proxy deployment: `deployERC1967Proxy` and `deployTransparentUpgradeableProxy`

- Added integration with [cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/) and [trezor](https://trezor.io/) wallets.

* Changed the way of naming for Truffle transactions to `txName`.

## Version 2.0.0

* Remove redundant initializers in a verifier task

## Version 2.0.0-alpha.19

## Version 2.0.0-alpha.18

* Handle the partially linked Bytecode in the Truffle Adapter.

## Version 2.0.0-alpha.17

* Separated the logic of the Reporter and moved transaction-related functions to the TransactionRunner class.

* Initially, the fully qualified name is used to retrieve a contract from the Transaction Storage.
* If the fully qualified name is absent, the recovery process falls back to using the `ContractFieldsToSave` derived from the contract.
* Should the name be located, the `ContractFieldsToSave` is disregarded and is not used as a key within the Transaction Storage.

## Version 2.0.0-alpha.2

* Library linking fully relies on the hardhat artifacts.

## Version 2.0.0-alpha.1

This release represents a major update to our plugin. We have completely rebuilt the core logic from scratch, now using ethersV6. 
Additionally, we have conducted a comprehensive code walkthrough, addressing and resolving bugs, as well as introducing new features.

### Breaking changes

* Removed the logger from migrations. Logging functionality is now fully integrated within the plugin.
* Restructured the arguments passed to the `deploy` function.
* Transitioned to using the `hardhat-verify` plugin for contract verification.

### Deployer

* Added support for EthersV5, EthersV6, and TruffleV5 through Adapters.
* Introduced types support for EthersV5 and EthersV6 only, including constructor arguments validation.
* Implemented a library linking during contract deployment.
* Enhanced reporting during contract deployment.
* Enabled recoverability of contract deployments.
* Improved error reporting during contract deployment.
* Added special user storage between deployments.

### Verifier

* Utilized the `hardhat-verify` plugin for contract verification.
* Added three types of verification: "immediately," "at-the-end," and "none."
* Introduced Verification processor and Verification Storage to enable verification of all deployed contracts at the end of the migration.
* Implemented verification error handling.
* Utilized Reporter to override the default 'hardhat-verify' logging.

## New tools

### Reporter

Centralizes all console logging.

### Storage

A module that stores necessary data for the migration process in a JSON file. 
The default path is the `artifacts/build-info` folder.
